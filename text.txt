HTML Introduction

 HTML is HyperText Markup Language.It is just language of web pages. it has tags, element tags,opening tags, closing tags.Browsers do not display the HTML tags, but use them to render the content of the page.HTML allows images and objects to be embedded
and can be used to create interactive forms.HTML is highly flexible and supported on all browsers.

 Basic Structure

 This is the basic structure to start designing & building WebApss or WebSites Pages. Every Page we open in browser have this syntax.

 <!DOCTYPE html>
   <html>
     <head>
        <title>  </title>
     </head>
     <body>
    
     </body>
  </html>

 To run this on you Oprating system by saving exact format with filename.html & open with any web browser

 <!DOCTYPE html>  This is stand for the version of html.there are many update version of html.this is used to so you  dont have to change its version on every new update. [!DOCTYPE HTML] automatic change according to updated versions.
 <html></html>  Web browser can open every kind of file so tell the browser & to arrange the syntax of html file this tag is needed.
 <head> </head>   The content in the head tags not shown in the browsers. This is used to store information about BackEnd, links or others purposes.
 <title>   </title>  Title is used to name of the page & this name is shown on the top of Web Browser Tabs.
 <body></body> Every thing we see on web browser is placed in this tag eg. images, tables, graph, heading etc.

HTML Editors

HTML Elements
 Mashup elements
  Mashup element contains content in them & These kind of element tag need a closing tag
   <tagname>  content comes in here... </tagname>
     <tagname>    this is opening tag 
     </tagname>   this is closing tag
   We always has to close a tag which contains content in them.
   Examples
     <div>     content comes in here...     </div>
     <table>   content comes in here...    </table>
     <a href="#">  content comes in here... </a>
 Empty Elements
  Empty Elements are those which do not need a closing tag.
   <br>
   <hr>
   <img>
  When you go to other language like react or react-native-app in future,then you need to close these tags.(<br />, <hr />)

HTML Attributes 
 Attributes Are used to define or change the type , class, method, style of content or link to other things.
 Example:
 <a href="#">  href is a attribute
 <div id="name" > id is a attribute
 <p class"text"> class is a attribute
 There are so many kind of attributes we will cover in next chapters.

HTML Paragraphs
 Paragraph is best way to show big text content on web pages. 
  <p>      content comes in here�.  </p>    <p> tag is used to make paragraph like in newspapers.
  <br>   This Tag is used give space between two different lines & start a new line from bottom start. Because HTML treat every element tag as inline.  
  <pre>  </pre> This tag show the exact syntax in which we wrote text in notepad  
Examples:
<p>hello friends,,...this is paragrap.</p>
<p>hello friends,,...   <br>    this is paragraph.</p>
<pre> 
hello friends,,... 
  this is paragraph.
           Thank You
</pre>


HTML Headers
Headers are used to give headings or title to paragraph. Font weight of header is greater then the font of default text on page. 
 <h1> header 1 </h1>
<h2> header 2 </h2>
<h3> header 3 </h3>
<h4> header 4 </h4>
<h5> header 5 </h5>
<h6> header 6 </h6>

The size of <h1> is greater in size & getting small till <h6>

HTML Escape Characters
  html have its own syntax & language there for we cant use some character directly.
 Examples:
 [space]    &nbsp;
 &          &amp
 <          &lt
 >          &gt
 ?          &#63
 "          &quot
 '          &apos

 For space between two text we have to use &nbsp. because html treat multiple space as single space.There are many character you will find online according to use.
